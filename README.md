# Customer Segmentation and Campaign Response Prediction

This is a Capstone project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree parterning with [Arvato Financial Services][[https://finance.arvato.com/en-us/](https://finance.arvato.com/en-us/)]. In this project, demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany is provided along with the demographics information for the general population. We'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we'll build a machine model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. 

## Data

The raw data is proprietary so I won't share it in this repo.
